text = "Fi'l is defined as a word that has a tense. A Fi'l can be in the past, present, or future tense.

    Example
        PAST-TENSE Fi'l would be:
            - He stopped.
            - He gave.
        PRESENT-TENSE Fi'l would be:
            - He searches.
            - He learns.
        FUTURE-TENSE Fi'l would be:
            - He will succeed.
            - He will give up.


TIP:
    Place the word “I” before it. If it makes sense, it is a Fi'l.
    I came → This makes sense, so “came” is a Fi'l.
     I ice cream → This does not make sense, so “ice cream is
not a Fi'l"
